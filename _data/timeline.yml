  description: I work with Unreal Engine on porting technically demanding projects, primarily for Nintendo Switch but also for multiplatform releases.
               My main responsibility is to optimize graphics while preserving visual quality on hardware with limited capability, and over time I have gained strong theoretical and practical expertise in memory management and CPU optimization.

               I have contributed to several projects, including
               • Tales Of Kenzera Zau
               • Batman Arkham Trilogy
               • High On Life
